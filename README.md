# Welcome to my profile ðŸ¥³
Hello, I am **Pikod**. My real name is **Yahya**. I live in **Denizli, Turkey**
<br>I learned the programming languages on my own. I have been involved in many projects (Web sites, games, desktop softwares, applications...)

## My programming history âœ¨
My first experience with programming was in fifth grade. I was learning vbscript and c-sharp with visual studio. After being noticed by my teacher, I improved myself in electronics thanks to him. And finally, in the eighth grade, I learned web programming both back-end and front-end. After earn experience from many web projects I learned java. After that, I did Virtual Shop. Which is a visual shop plugin for minecraft.
