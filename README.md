# Welcome to my profile ðŸ¥³
Hello, I am **Pikod**. My real name is **Yahya**. I live in **Denizli, Turkey**
<br>I learned programming languages I know on my own. I have been involved in many projects (Web sites, games, desktop softwares, applications...)

## First Experience âœ¨
My first experience with programming was in fifth grade. I was learning vbscript and c-sharp with visual studio. After being noticed by my teacher, I improved myself in electronics thanks to my teacher. And finally, in the eighth grade, I improved myself in web programming both back-end and front-end. After many web projects I learned java while trying to make my own minecraft client (And I was successful at this.). After that, I did Virtual Shop. It was a huge project for me it took me 2 weeks. Now I know almost all famous programming languages.
